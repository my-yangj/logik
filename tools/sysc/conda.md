## quote from conda doc
- Building a conda package requires a recipe. A conda-build recipe is a flat directory that contains the following files:
- meta.yaml---A file that contains all the metadata in the recipe. Only package/name and package/version are required.
- build.sh---The script that installs the files for the package on macOS and Linux. It is executed using the bash command.
- bld.bat---The build script that installs the files for the package on Windows. It is executed using cmd.
- run_test.[py,pl,sh,bat]---An optional Python test file, a test script that runs automatically if it is part of the recipe.
- Optional patches that are applied to the source.
- Other resources that are not included in the source and cannot be generated by the build scripts.
